# Architecture

`tap-sdk` is a client-side SDK for applications that talk to `tapd`, the
Taproot Assets daemon. The root package exposes the business API; transport
packages own wire formats and connection setup.

The current Go implementation is the source of truth for the public API model,
but the design is intentionally language-portable. Future TypeScript, Rust,
Python, Kotlin, and Swift SDKs should expose the same business concepts even if
their package layout differs.

## Package Boundaries

| Package | Boundary |
|---------|----------|
| `tapsdk` | Business API, domain types, high-level wallet/issuer/universe surfaces, builders, errors |
| `grpc` | Native gRPC client, TLS setup, macaroon auth, proto marshal/unmarshal |
| `rest` | REST client, TLS setup, macaroon auth, JSON marshal/unmarshal, WebSocket event streams |
| `macaroon` | Low-level macaroon source helpers shared by transports |
| `internal/anchor` | Anchor PSBT helpers |
| `internal/codec` | Internal TLV/alt-leaf/STXO encoding helpers |
| `internal/vpsbt` | Virtual PSBT encoding for interactive transfers |

The root package must not import transport packages. Transports import the
root package and return root SDK types. That one-way dependency keeps the
business API stable even if the repo layout changes later.

## Domain Model

The SDK separates user-facing business concepts from tapd protocol details.

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `AssetRef` | Opaque, storable handle for an asset in the SDK API |
| `Asset` | A fungible token or one NFT item |
| `Collection` | A group of NFT items |
| `Issuance` | One concrete protocol issuance/tranche of a fungible asset |
| `AssetRecord` | Low-level wallet row that still exposes protocol details |
| `Balance` | Confirmed balance for one semantic `AssetRef` |
| `Transfer` / `Burn` | Asset movement or destruction keyed by `AssetRef` |

Grouped fungibles are keyed by group `AssetRef`. Standalone NFTs and NFT
collection items are keyed by asset-ID `AssetRef`. Collections are keyed by
group `AssetRef`, but a collection is not itself an asset.

See [Asset Model](asset-model.md) for more detail.

## High-Level Surfaces

### Wallet

`Wallet` is the primary application surface. It wraps a `Client` and exposes
common operations using `AssetRef`:

- receive addresses
- sends and multi-sends
- balances, assets, issuances, collections, transfers
- proof import/export
- burns
- ownership proofs
- transaction builders
- event listeners
- access to `Issuer` and `Universe`

Low-level RPC-shaped methods remain available through `wallet.Client()` for
advanced callers.

### Issuer

`Issuer` hides tapd mint batch mechanics behind business actions:

- `CreateFungible`
- `IssueFungible`
- `CreateNFT`
- `CreateCollection`
- `MintCollectionItem`

The issuer serializes its own mint operations because tapd has one active mint
batch per daemon. If a mint result times out while resolving, callers should
inspect wallet assets or batches before retrying to avoid duplicate issuance.

### Universe

`Universe` is the high-level discovery and proof surface:

- `HasAsset`
- `GetRoots`
- `ListProofs`
- `GetProof`
- `SyncAsset`
- `SyncAssets`

The high-level API takes `AssetRef`. The low-level `UniverseClient` remains
available for direct protocol-shaped universe operations.

## Transport Model

Both transports satisfy the same root `Client` interface.

```go
type Client interface {
    WalletClient
    WalletKitClient
    ProofClient
    UniverseClient
    MintClient
    EventClient
    Close() error
}
```

The gRPC transport consumes native server-streaming RPCs. The REST transport
uses tapd's grpc-gateway JSON endpoints and WebSocket bridge for event streams.
Both transports map tapd responses to the same root SDK types and error
surface.

## TLS and Macaroons

Transport configs accept typed TLS and macaroon sources:

```go
client, err := tapgrpc.NewClient(&tapgrpc.Config{
    Host:     "localhost:10029",
    Network:  tapsdk.NetworkRegtest,
    TLS:      tapgrpc.TLSFromPath("/path/to/tls.cert"),
    Macaroon: tapsdk.MacaroonFromPath("/path/to/admin.macaroon"),
})
```

TLS supports:

- default tapd certificate path
- certificate file
- certificate PEM data
- system certificate pool
- explicit insecure mode for local tests
- minimum TLS version
- optional SHA-256 certificate pinning

Macaroons can be loaded from one file, a directory of per-service macaroons,
or one hex-encoded macaroon.

See [Transports and Auth](transports.md).

## Events

The low-level `EventClient` streams tapd event records. The high-level
`EventListener` projects those records into SDK business events:

- `MintEvent`
- `SendEvent`
- `ReceiveEvent`

Transfer rows include tapd asset type data. The SDK uses that field to keep
grouped fungibles keyed by group `AssetRef` while NFT collection items stay
keyed by concrete item `AssetRef`.

## Error Surface

SDK methods wrap failures in `*tapsdk.Error` where possible:

```go
type Error struct {
    Op  string
    Err error
}
```

Errors preserve the underlying gRPC status when available, including REST
responses that originate from grpc-gateway. Common conditions also map to
sentinel errors such as `ErrAssetUnknown`, `ErrInsufficientBalance`,
`ErrProofNotFound`, `ErrPermissionDenied`, and `ErrUnsupportedByTapd`.

## Compatibility Boundary

The SDK targets tapd v0.8.0 or newer. Older versions do not expose enough
asset type data for the SDK to reliably distinguish grouped fungibles from NFT
collection items across transfers, burns, and events.

See [Compatibility](compatibility.md).

## Design Principles

1. **Developer-facing first.** The SDK should expose business operations, not
   raw tapd nouns, unless a caller intentionally drops to the low-level client.
2. **`AssetRef` everywhere.** Application code should store and pass one asset
   handle across wallet, issuer, proof, burn, event, and universe flows.
3. **Honest names.** Assets, collections, and issuances are distinct concepts.
   The SDK should not hide that distinction behind a generic type.
4. **Transport parity.** gRPC and REST should return the same SDK types and
   comparable errors.
5. **Portable API model.** Go package layout should not leak into the long-term
   SDK model intended for other languages.
